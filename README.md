# Superstore Retail Analytics - Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

# Project Brief
This project was completed as part of my Codveda Internship (Level 1: Basic).
Since Codveda only provided task objectives, I simulated a dummy retail company case study by building my own business scenario, project brief, and report around an open-source dataset.

The project combines two tasks in one:
- Data Collection & Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights and recommendations.

# Business Scenario
A retail company suspects that high discounts and certain product categories are driving profit losses.
They want to understand:

- Which categories, regions, and products are performing well?
- Where are profits being eroded by excessive discounts?
- What trends exist in monthly sales & profit over time?

As a Data Analyst, my job is to clean the dataset, explore it, and deliver insights that guide profit improvement decisions.

# Task Objectives
## Task 2 ‚Äî Data Collection & Cleaning
- Import data from an open-source retail dataset.
- Ensure correct data types (date, currency, percentage).
- Handle missing values and outliers using IQR method.
- Standardize values (discounts, categories).
- Document all cleaning actions in a Cleaning Log.

## Task 3 ‚Äî Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generate descriptive statistics (mean, median, std. dev, min, max).
- Analyze sales & profit trends over time.
- Compare category, sub-category, and regional performance.
- Identify top products by profit and loss-making products.
- Investigate relationship between discount and profit.
- Summarize insights and provide business recommendations.

# Business Questions
- What are the overall sales, profit, and average discount levels?
- Which product categories and sub-categories generate the most profit?
- Which regions are underperforming despite high sales?
- Which products are top profit drivers, and which consistently make losses?
- How do discounts affect profit margins?
- What trends can be observed over time (monthly/annual sales & profit)?

# Tools Used
- Excel: Data Cleaning, PivotTables, Charts, Statistical Functions
- OBS Studio: For screen recording project explanation (LinkedIn proof-of-work)
- CapCut / Clipchamp: For video editing & narration

# Dataset Information
- Source: Open-source Sample Superstore dataset (commonly used in analytics projects).
- Type: Structured tabular data (CSV ‚Üí imported to Excel).
- Records: 9,995 rows
- Fields: Order Date, Category, Sub-Category, Region, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit, etc.

# Key Insights
- üìâ Discounts hurt profitability: Higher discounts show a negative correlation with profit.
- ü™ë Furniture (Tables, Bookcases) sub-category often runs at a loss despite strong sales.
- üåç West Region outperforms others in profit, while some regions have high sales but thin margins.
- üèÜ Top 10 products drive a disproportionate share of profit.
- üö© Loss-making products need immediate review ‚Äî possible candidates for delisting or price/discount adjustments.

# Deliverables
- Excel Workbook (template-based):
- Orders (raw + cleaned data)
- Cleaning_Log
- EDA_Summary
- EDA_Pivots + Charts
- Insights
- README, Project Info, Deliverables Checklist, Data Dictionary
- Business Report (PDF) summarizing scenario, questions, analysis, and insights.
- Project Brief (PDF) documenting objectives & expected deliverables.
- Video Explanation posted on LinkedIn (screen recording + narration).

# How to Use
- Download the full Excel file ‚Üí [Excel Template](Superstore_Level1_Template.xlsx)
- Open in Excel to explore:
- Cleaning Log
- PivotTables & Charts
- Insights & Recommendations
- Read the Business Report - [Business Report](Sales_Profitability_Business_Report.pdf)
- Read Project Brief for documentation of the analysis process

# Next Steps
- Future iterations will include:
- Level 2 (Intermediate): SQL for Business Analytics & Dashboarding (Power BI / Tableau).
- Level 3 (Advanced): Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics using Python.

üí° This project demonstrates my ability to take raw objectives and transform them into a structured analytics case study, from cleaning through insights ‚Äî using Excel as the core tool.
